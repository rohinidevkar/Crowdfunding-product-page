# Crowdfunding-product-page

Your challenge is to build out this crowdfunding product page and get it looking as close to the design as possible. You can use any tools you like to help you 
complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go. Your users should be able to:
View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size and See hover states for interactive elements.
Make a selection of which pledge to make . See an updated progress bar and total money raised based on their pledge total after confirming a pledge
See the number of total backers increment by one after confirming a pledge and Toggle whether or not the product is bookmarked.
